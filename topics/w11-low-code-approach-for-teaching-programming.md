# W11 - Low Code Approach for Teaching Programming

Imagine being a 10-year-old discovering programming for the first time. Instead of struggling with intricate text or confusing symbols, you are building programs by snapping together colorful blocks, just like assembling Lego. With a few clicks, you can bring characters on your screen to life. That's the beauty of Scratch&mdash;a visual programming language that makes coding simple, exciting, and full of creativity for everyone.

### Why low code approaches?

Programming was once an exclusive club of mathematicians and computer scientists, but Scratch helped change this narrative. As Scratch creators argue, the platform is not just a tool for learning to code, it is also a medium for expression, creativity, and community building. Scratch enables users, especially children and educators, to create interactive stories, animations, and games while developing computational thinking skills.

But Scratch is not alone. Over the years, an ecosystem of visual programming tools has emerged, each innovating in unique ways. Let's take a journey through some of the most impactful alternatives, compare them to Scratch, and explore how these tools are shaping the future of programming.

## The Rise of Visual Programming

### Scratch: Programming for all

Developed by the MIT Media Lab, Scratch stands out for its simplicity and inclusivity, making programming accessible to beginners of all ages. By utilizing a drag-and-drop interface, Scratch eliminates the barriers of intimidating syntax, allowing users to focus on logic and creativity rather than technical details. Its block-based approach represents programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and variables in an intuitive way. Scratch's online community plays an essential role, enabling users to share projects and remix others' work, enhancing collaborative learning and fostering a sense of belonging.

### Algot: Build Programs by Demonstration

While Scratch focuses on accessibility, Algot addresses the cognitive challenges associated with programming. According to Algot creators, visual languages like Algot can reduce cognitive load compared to traditional text-based languages like Python. Algot allows students to build programs by demonstration, meaning they can manipulate data directly and see immediate results. For undergraduates and first-time learners, this approach lowers the barriers to grasping fundamental concepts, making programming more approachable and less intimidating.

### Strawbies: A Tangible Programming Game

Taking a step beyond the screen, Strawbies combines tactile and digital learning, making programming more accessible to children aged 5 and up. Using physical coding blocks and an interactive platform, players can guide characters through a world filled with interactive objects that encourage problem-solving and creativity. Designed for collaboration, it allows groups to play together and by integrating physical interaction enhances the understanding and retention of learning concepts.

## Not Just for Kids: Bridging the Gap from Blocks to Code

Visual programming is not only child's play, it is also transforming how people of all ages engage with technology and easing the transition to traditional programming languages.

### Bridging the Gap with Hybrid Tools

Transitioning from beginner-friendly tools like Scratch to more complex programming environments can be challenging. Platforms like Blockly and Alice have emerged to bridge this gap. Blockly plays a key role by enabling a smooth transition from block-based interfaces to text-based programming. It provides a dual interface where users can see the equivalent text-based code generated from their block-based programs, allowing learners to gradually adopt traditional languages such as JavaScript or Python. This transparency allows for the demystification of syntax, showing learners how their logical constructs built with blocks are translated into actual code.

Similarly, Alice complements this approach with an immersive 3D interface that introduces fundamental programming concepts. By allowing users to manipulate objects in a 3D space while introducing Java or C++ code snippets, it provides a gentle introduction to textual programming and helps learners visualise abstract ideas in an engaging and intuitive way.

### Real-World Applications and Motivation

For teens and adults, MIT's App Inventor connects programming with real-world applications. Users design and build mobile apps, learning coding principles while solving meaningful problems. By focusing on outcomes that matter to users, App Inventor motivates learning through practical relevance. It is not just about coding, it is also about creating tools that can impact daily life.

### Educational Strategies for Transitioning

Educators are developing curricula that integrate visual and textual programming. By starting with block-based coding to build confidence and then introducing text-based languages, learners can transfer their understanding of programming concepts without being overwhelmed by syntax. Studies have shown that this scaffolding approach can lead to better retention and a deeper understanding of programming principles.

## The future beyond blocks

As technology evolves, so do the tools we use to teach and learn programming. Visual programming is set to expand in fascinating directions.

### AI-Assisted Programming

Imagine a future where programming starts with something as simple as a conversation. Users could describe what they want to build in natural language, and artificial intelligence would interpret their ideas and generate initial code structures in a block-based visual programming environment. This approach allows users to see their concepts take shape immediately, bridging their natural expressions with computational logic. As they refine their projects and improve their knowledge, they could move to mixed tools that combine visual blocks with text-based code snippets, offering greater control and complexity. Finally, this progression would lead learners into traditional programming languages such as Python or Java, equipped with a solid understanding of programming concepts and structures. AI would support them every step of the way, providing real-time feedback, personalised learning paths and error detection, making the journey from idea to implementation more intuitive than ever before.

### Mixed Reality

The success of Strawbies suggests the potential of combining physical interaction with digital programming. Mixed reality technologies, which include both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), could take this even further by immersing learners in a 3D programming environment. Imagine seeing how different components interact in real time, and making changes with a simple gesture. By introducing the concept of programming by demonstration, users can define behaviour and logic by directly interacting with virtual objects. For example, physically manipulating virtual elements, such as moving a character or changing an object could automatically generate the underlying code to replicate those actions. This method allows learners to program by showing rather than telling, using intuitive, natural interactions to build complex programs.

Mixed reality environments leverage these interactions, making coding more accessible, engaging and aligned with the way we naturally explore and learn. By blending the physical and digital worlds, they open up new possibilities for experiential learning, where the boundary between programmer and program becomes fluid and dynamic.
